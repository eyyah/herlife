# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This document outlines the plan to resolve a critical Android build failure in the Flutter project. The application is currently unable to build due to an incompatibility with the `flutter_sms` package.

## The Problem

The project is failing to build for Android with the error: `Namespace not specified` in the `flutter_sms` package. This is because the version of `flutter_sms` being used is not compatible with the modern Android Gradle Plugin versions used in this project.

### Failed Attempts

Several attempts to fix the issue have been unsuccessful:

1.  **Updating `minSdkVersion` and `multidex`:** These were not the root cause.
2.  **Updating various dependencies:** While some packages were outdated, this did not solve the core incompatibility with `flutter_sms`.
3.  **Attempting to directly patch the package:** This failed due to an inability to access the pub cache directly.

## The Path Forward: Stabilize and Replace

The following plan will be executed to get the application back to a runnable state and then re-implement the SMS functionality correctly.

### Step 1: Remove the Problematic Package

To get the application building again, the `flutter_sms` package will be temporarily removed.

*   **Action:** Remove the `flutter_sms` dependency from `pubspec.yaml`.
*   **Action:** Run `flutter pub get` to update the project.

### Step 2: Restore Core Functionality

With the problematic package removed, the application's core features will be restored. This will involve updating the code to remove any references to the `flutter_sms` package.

### Step 3: Find a Suitable Replacement for SMS Functionality

With the application in a stable state, a modern, maintained, and compatible package for sending SMS messages will be researched and integrated. This will ensure that the SMS functionality is restored without compromising the project's stability.
